# The Virtual D20

A console application for single and multiple dice rolls for tabletop gaming.

## Installation

download Virtual_D20.py and run in Terminal

```bash
python3 Virtual_D20.py
```

## Mission Statement

To create an easy to use and functional application which allows the user to input dicerolls and returns a simple randomly generated value. I need to ensure no undesired inputs cause bugs or crashes, and all code is efficient and easy to read.

## Usage

Enter desired dice roll in the format d(number) or for multiple rolls (number)d(number). Example: d10, d20, 3d6, 4d4 etc.
